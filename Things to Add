Things to do and add

- Chatting in the terminal will only get a response if there is a DONG nearby their terminal and willing to communicate.
- Food/Fruit to spawn only close to trees. This way Dongs will learn where to find food.
- Make Dongs interact with each other and communicate so that they may grow and learn
- make sure when they breed, they only have 1-3 offspring at a time.  each offspring is created with 50% genetic information and 50% neural network information from each parent.
- Dongs will want to rest when energy is low or perhaps boredom factor goes up. Whilst they rest, their Neural Networks will retrain themselves with any new information they've picked up
- Dongs want to find food to eat, learn, play, communicate with each other/the "LLM God"/or the User, and breed as well when energy and attraction permit
- this will increase size of Neural Net in each Dong.
